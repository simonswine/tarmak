## [0.6.0]: 0.6.0 - 2019-02-27

The 0.6 release of Tarmak comes with many more features and improvements to
internals. Notable new additions include pre-built AMI images that are used when
one has not yet been built, making getting a cluster running for new users much
faster. A new worker AMI image type that will pre-install and configure Kubernetes
worker nodes so nodes become ready much faster during auto scaling. Finally, we
have also included an option to deploy Calico using Kubernetes as a backend,
rather than using Etcd directly.

A large focus of this release has been on improving the use of SSH by now
utilising the in package standard Go libraries. This has meant we now have
better control of SSH connections whilst running. We have also developed a
significant change to how SSH host keys are handled, whereby instances will now
tag themselves with their public keys securely, via an Amazon Lambda function.
These tags are then used to populate, verify and update our local host key file
during SSH connections.

We do not report any specific action required for upgrading to 0.6.0 from 0.5.3
besides our normal upgrade method.

## [0.4.0]: 0.4.0 - 2018-08-07

### Added
- Add Tarmak Terraform provider for ordering infrastructure creation (#12, @simonswine)
- Add support for automatically adding taints and labels to instance pools (#369, @charlieegan3)
- Support log forwarding (#197, @dippynark)
- Add Jenkins module to Terraform stack (#240, @MattiasGees)
- Support autoscaling arbitrary worker instance pools (#325, @dippynark)

### Changed
- Merged Terraform stacks (state, bastion, vault, network, kubernetes) into a single stack. This allows a plan to be run against all infrastructure at the same time and also benefit from Terraform's parallelisation  capabilities (#148, @dippynark)
- Vendor Terraform instead of shelling out to binary inside the Tarmak Docker container. This gives us more control over how terraform is run and the version used. Care must be take when running terraform commands within the Tarmak debug shell as using a version of Tarmak higher than the version vendored by Tarmak will prevent Tarmak from running further Terraform commands
- Change cgroup driver from systemd to cgroupfs as cgroupfs has better support in the kubelet for enforcing node allocatable (#300, @dippynark)

# Fixed
- Add security group to allow cluster autoscaler scaping (#338, @dippynark)
- Remove unneeded infrastructure (#329 #336 #321 @dippynark @MattiasGees)
- Pass through etcd instance pool min count to puppet (#322, @dippynark)
- Fix etcd mount race condition (#313, @dippynark)
- Add RBAC support to Dashboard (#343, @dippynark)
- Use correct versions for cluster autoscaler (#346, @dippynark)
- Return informative error when failing to parse tarmak configuration (#326, @dippynark)
- Use ClusterFirstWithHostNet for fluent-bit ds (#319, @charlieegan3)
- Prepare Terraform when running kubectl (#185, @dippynark)
