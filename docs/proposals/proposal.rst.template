My Proposal
===========

.. todo::

  1-2 sentence summary of the proposal

Background
----------

.. todo::

   Provide some context to the situation now (e.g. current situation, short
   comings, future challenges, ...)


Objective
---------

.. todo::

    What are we going to do to make the situation described above better? (high
    level design overview, goals & considerations)


Changes
-------

.. todo::

    Detail the actual changes that will need to be made here. If it needs be,
    use (annotated) code-snippets to illustrate the required changes. This sort
    of specs out the work required, but obviously is subject to change once
    implementation starts (if it has not already)

    It should also plan out how a larger proposal can be broken down into
    several releasable iterations.


Notable items
-------------

.. todo::

    Here we can call out things that are particularly bad,
    good, difficult or whatever else. Anything **notable**.

Out of scope
------------

.. todo::

    Puts a *bound* on the scope of the work. This may not be applicable all the
    time, but it's useful to include if there's any ambiguity as to whether
    something should or should not be done.
